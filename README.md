# ASCII-horses
ASCII horses is a simple python script that generates random virtual horses races in the terminal.

## Usage
```bash
chmod +x ascii_horses.py
./ascii_horses.py
```

## Randomness
As of now, the randomness is based on the current time, is not so random. I'm planning to implement a better randomness algorithm in the future.

## Notice
Is possible for more than one horse to finish at the same time, in this case, it will print the horses that won.
